# Biduul

> A trading application for Binance.

Biduul is a 100% free and open-sourced tool to simplify trading process as much as possible. We're the team of professional traders and developers and our goal is to join these two skills to make trading to be fun and simple.

## Widgets

Biduul provides a friendly configureble UI to maximize your trading performance. Widgets can be resized easily and some of them can be configured with the settings icon. 

### Trade with one button!

Trading is different to working for a salary on a regular job. Instead of earning fixed amount of money, trading allows to earn percents of your balance.

Since our trading goal is based on percents, we've created a widget that makes possible to make a bid of given percent in one button. Those values are configurable at widget settings.

### Candle chart

We have created an inovative tool to trade, create alerts, measure further liquidation price by using just a computer mouse.

#### Draft orders

You can create so-called "draft order" using right click on the chart (this works for limit orders only). The click will create a line that you're able to drag and choose a desired price for your order without filling it in manually.

#### Positions and orders on the chart

All your positions and orders are displayed on the chart and order lines can be dragged to change their price and re-create an order.

#### Price alerts 

Make a right click on the chart to creatre alert. An alert line is going to appear and the alert line can be dragged with the mouse if you want to change your choice of price. Alerts can be created in one click making you focus on trading itself without spending any additional second.

#### Draft orders 

Double click on the chart is going to create so-called "draft order". This is the similar to the alert line that also can be dragged to a price where you want to create a limit order (you need to switch to "Limit" tab of the Trading widget and put needed amount there).

#### Predictive liquidation line

Biduul predicts liqidation price based on current position, draft order and open orders. The price is displayed as a dashed line to let you know when your position is going to be liquidated after the orders are fulfilled.

### Wallet

The wallet widget shows not only your balance, but also Unrealized PNL to make you see how much you're going to loose or win if you close all positions, Position/Order margin that says how much money have you put into all of your orsers and positions, and some additional useful information.

### Minicharts

This widget shows candle charts for all of the futures markets. You can also take a look at the standalone tool called [minichart-grid](https://letiliel.github.io/minichart-grid/).

We work hard on making Biduul the best trading instrument on the market (still being completely open-sourced) and more widgets will come in future.

## Plugins

Biduul has a powerful plugin system. We can say with confidence that Biduul is the most configureble trading application ever made by humans! With intuitive API and modern web development technologies you (or anybody who knows JavaScript) can make whatever you want: create widgets, implement automated strategies, add third-party APIs.
