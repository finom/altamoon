## Widgets

Biduul provides a friendly configureble UI to maximize your trading performance. Widgets can be resized easily and some of them can be configured with the settings icon. 

### Trade with one button!

Trading is different to working for a salary on a regular job. Instead of earning fixed amount of money, trading allows to earn percents of your balance. If you have $1000 on your balance and you able to make 1% every day, your balance will increase no just $10 per day, but based on compoind interest calculations your first million of dollars is going to appear on your balance in 700 days which is less than two years. If you make 10% every day (which is enormous number!) you're going to be come a millionaire in 75 days!

Since our trading goal is based on percents, we've created a widget that makes possible to make a bid of given percent in one button.

#### Price alerts 

Make a right click on the chart to creatre alert. An alert line is going to appear and the alert line can be dragged with the mouse if you want to change your choice of price. No minual input of expected price anymore! Alerts can be created in one click making you focus on trading itself without spending any additional second.

#### Draft orders 

Double click on the chart is going to create so-called "draft order". This is the similar to the alert line that also can be dragged to a price where you want to create a limit order (you need to switch to "Limit" tab of the Trading widget and put needed amount there).
